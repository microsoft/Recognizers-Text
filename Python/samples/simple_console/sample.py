\" I\'ll be available tomorrow from 11am to 2pm to receive up to 5kg of sugar\"
\" I\'ll be out between 4 and 22 this month\"
\" I was the fifth person to finish the 10 km race\"
\" The temperature this night will be of 40 deg celsius\"
\" The american stock exchange said a seat was sold for down $ 5,000 from the\
